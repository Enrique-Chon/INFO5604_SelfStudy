document math self-study resources for machine learning class

The files shared in this repository consist mainly of lectures from a geophysical inverse theory course in which I am registered as an 'observer' in CANVAS. This course meets once per week, and it is taught by my graduate advisor. There are homework assignments associated with each week, however I have decided not to share those documents to preserve integrity for future offerings of this course (I did not always do the problem sets and coding assignments, but I do not wish to post any solutions and/or answer keys to be found by future students of this course).
