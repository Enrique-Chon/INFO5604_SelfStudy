# INFO5604_SelfStudy
The purpose of this repo is to document math self-study resources for a machine learning class at CU Boulder.
Slowly, it is shaping up to function also as a bookmarks folder, keeping track of useful resources for my course project.

The files shared in this repository consist mainly of lectures from a geophysical inverse theory course in which I am registered as an 'observer' in CANVAS. This course meets once per week, and it is taught by my graduate advisor. There are homework assignments associated with each week, however I have decided not to share those documents to preserve integrity for future offerings of this course (I did not always do the problem sets and coding assignments, but I do not wish to post any solutions and/or answer keys to be found by future students of this course). 

Two other files exist (ML_in_Seismology and Misc.CodingArticles), containing links to useful resources for math and programming related to my research and ML + short descriptions of URL's, DOI's and/or citations.
